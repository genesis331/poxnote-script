[8 June]
[Meeting]
PT: These are the prototypes of the new series. Is there anything to add on?
DT: (Jinny) I think the diamond of ‘Lily’ can be bigger. It is 2.6cm x 2.6cm on my draft but I only see 2.3cm x 2.3cm on your prototype.
PT: That could be the measurement error. We would modify it.
DT: (Amy) My high-heel includes 7cm and 9cm. 
PT: Okay, we would add the 9cm one later.
Boss: I think the colour of Karena’s sneakers should be lighter, like mint-green instead of army green.
DT: (Karena) Yes, but not as light as mint green. Just one tone lighter than army green, like #7d8a24.
PT: Okay, got it. Is there any other problem?
DT: No, thanks.
PT: Alright, we would get it done by 14 June.

[Production team after meeting]
Director: Group 1 and 2, modify the prototype based on what they said just now and let me check. I’ll submit it to both the designer and boss once you’ve sent it to me. Hopefully we can get it done by 10 June since the factory is quite busy, they might not be able to proceed with our orders asap.
